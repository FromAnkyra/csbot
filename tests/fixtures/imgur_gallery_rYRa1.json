Your case is kinda like your skeleton. (Sorry about the body analogies that I'm gonna use. They will probably be everywhere cus they work.) It will house everything.\n\n- Your case needs to be large enough to fit your motherboard. Your motherboard will have a size (e.g. ATX, XL ATX, Mini ITX) and on the case manufacturer's website you can check to make sure your case is compatible.\n\n- Check if the case has grommets or somewhere to hide your wires.\n\n- Some cases have a nice little window you can see your PC through. If you want one, keep an eye out!\n\n- Cases come in different sizes. There is the mini-itx cases that are made for compact PCs, all the way up to gigantic metal box things that you could probably get lost in. Be sure to pick something to suit yourself. If you are planning on maybe moving the PC to the TV to play there every once in a while, then be sure to get a smaller case. If you want a case that you won't move but can't be too large because you don't have enough space, go for a medium sized case.\n\n- Different cases are good at different things. A case like the H440 is really good at keeping things silent, but because of this it sacrifices some cooling ability. It is great if you plan on watercooling. On the other hand something like the NZXT Phantom series is louder but has better air cooling capabilities. You could also go for something like the case pictured above. That is the Fractal Design R5. It has a good mix of quietness and cooling capabilities. \n\n- Get something you like the look of. If that means small, sleek, and minimalist, go for it. If it means it will resemble a fireworks show, go for it!\n\n- For anyone that is interested in having fully controllable LEDs in their PC, have a look at the NZXT Hue. It gives you full control over ~2m of RGB LEDs, so that is pretty cool.","datetime":1454770418,"type":"image\/jpeg","animated":false,"width":1920,"height":1000,"size":678893,"views":89168,"bandwidth":60535531024,"vote":null,"favorite":false,"nsfw":null,"section":null,"account_url":null,"account_id":null,"comment_preview":null,"link":"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rx4VKQn.jpg","comment_count":null,"ups":null,"downs":null,"points":null,"score":null},{"id":"Gaxg7xJ","title":"Motherboard (Mobo)","description":"Your motherboard is the spine of the computer. It is where you will connect everything.\n\n- The first thing to check is the socket type. If you are planning on an intel CPU be sure that the socket type is compatible. Just because it says 'Intel\/AMD motherboard' does not mean it is compatible with all CPUs of the brand. \n\n- Check the chipset. This is not something you should worry about too much, but be sure to google it before agreeing to spend a bunch of money on something. Different chipsets are kind of like different versions. They all do roughly the same thing but some have extra features and are therefore more expensive. \n\n- Check if it deals well with overclocking. Overclocking is pushing your CPU to run faster than it is supposed to. This may shorten its lifespan or even kill it if you are negligent, so do be careful. If you plan on overclocking be sure your motherboard can handle it.\n\n- Be sure to check how many ports it has. Are you that one guy that has 48 things plugged in at all times no matter what? If so, be sure to check how many ports it has. If the motherboard doesn't have enough be sure to buy enough extensions. \n\n- Check for RAM support. The amount of RAM you have may affect your performance. A motherboard will normally have 4 slots for RAM until you get into the higher price ranges. If you plan on doing something RAM intensive like video editing be sure to get a motherboard that has enough space for however much RAM you may need. A motherboard that has 4 slots for RAM and supports 32 GB of RAM will not be able to run more than 32GB just because you bought 16 GB RAM sticks.\n\n- Check for WiFi and Bluetooth. All motherboards will come with an ethernet port, but if you don't have access to one be sure to check for wifi capabilities and to buy a WiFi card to equip if needed. The same applies if you may need bluetooth.\n\n- Check for PCIe slots. These are where you plug stuff like GPUs (Graphics Cards) and WiFi or sound cards. \n\n- Don't get caught by the gaming motherboard hype. A black and red Asus motherboard may look nice, but chances are it is overpriced and you are better spending your money on a better GPU or something.","datetime":1454770398,"type":"image\/jpeg","animated":false,"width":480,"height":334,"size":124257,"views":94471,"bandwidth":11738683047,"vote":null,"favorite":false,"nsfw":null,"section":null,"account_url":null,"account_id":null,"comment_preview":null,"link":"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Gaxg7xJ.jpg","comment_count":null,"ups":null,"downs":null,"points":null,"score":null},{"id":"kvSxTyS","title":"Processor (CPU)","description":"This is the brain of your computer. It does all the thinking type stuff.\n\n- Intel or AMD? Honestly, doesn't matter too much. If you are going for a budget build, AMD is your best bet. They tend to have a lower price\/performance ratio than Intel CPUs. If you are willing to stretch the budget a little an Intel CPU will handle it self very nicely.\n\n- NEVER compare based off of cores and gigahertz. Different chips are not equal in efficiency. The AMD FX-8350 is an 8 core 4 Ghz processor, whereas the i5 4690k beats it out in performance in most cases despite being 3.9 Ghz and only 4 cores.\n\n- To 'K' or not to 'K'. Intel CPUs will often come in with a K version. For instance there is the i5 4690 and the i5 4690k. K basically means unlocked multiplier. What this means is that you can overclock the CPU if you wanna. If you don't ever plan on overclocking, save yourself the money. \n\n- Be sure to buy for your situation. If you will be video editing, go for a high end i7. Gaming? Mid tier i5. School work? an i3 will do. Of course, you can always pay more for a bit of an upgrade but you definitely don't need some 3000 dollar processor just so you can play solitaire while avoiding your essay. \n","datetime":1454770410,"type":"image\/jpeg","animated":false,"width":500,"height":488,"size":34873,"views":52489,"bandwidth":1830448897,"vote":null,"favorite":false,"nsfw":null,"section":null,"account_url":null,"account_id":null,"comment_preview":null,"link":"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kvSxTyS.jpg","comment_count":null,"ups":null,"downs":null,"points":null,"score":null},{"id":"84HLdiw","title":"CPU Cooler","description":"This is like your... sweat? I dunno.... Bear with me on this. Your CPU Cooler cools down your CPU.\n\n- Your CPU will already come with a cooler of its own, but it will be louder and less efficient at getting rid of heat than a 3rd party one will be. \n\n- Unless you are planning on overclocking or you want your PC to be quieter\/cooler you shouldn't even bother to pay more. \n\n- Be sure the CPU cooler will fit your socket and your case. Some CPU coolers are designed specifically to fit AMD or Intel, and their bracket (the thing that will hold them to the motherboard over the CPU) won't fit a different socket type. If you have bought a mini ITX case don't be surprised when a massive cooler covers your RAM slots and won't let your side door close. Be sure it will fit before you buy it.\n\n- Decide: Air or water? A water cooler will be more efficient at cooling and probably more quiet, but will be more expensive. Be sure to check out warranties. If your CPU cooler leaks and it turns out the manufacturer doesn't cover extra damages it may not be worth the risk. An air cooler will be cheaper and probably easier to manage but also might not look as nice as a sleek watercooler.\n\n- Google reviews. Be sure that the model you are looking at does its job well. Be sure it does it quietly. \n\n- A cooler will come with its own fans. In most cases they suck. If you wanna buy new ones for even better cooling and even quieter performance you can go for Noctua (ugly in my opinion but undoubtedly the best PC case fans) or for something else, depending on your price range. PC fans are rather expensive and buying multiple ones will add up quick.

If you don't mind turning down the settings a little you may jump over to the AMD side for an R9 380. If you wanna buy 3 monitors with a ton of pixels be sure to spend more money to make sure you can actually run games well on it.\n\n- about 60% of your budget should go towards your GPU.

Sorry. This analogy is dead. I won't use it any more.\n\n- Currently, there is DDR3 and DDR4 RAM on the market. DDR4 RAM is super expensive as of now, but is considerably faster than DDR3. If you wanna spend the extra money on DDR4 memory, be sure that you buy a motherboard that will support it.\n\n- RAM has different 'speeds'. (e.g. 1333 mHZ, 1600 mHZ). For the most part a difference in speed probably won't make a significant impact on you. If the upgrade is considerably more expensive then just don't bother. For DDR3 1600 mHZ is about standard.\n\n- Currently for gaming 8GB is roughly the sweet spot. Some games are coming in that will begin to use more RAM than this, especially at higher settings so I would recommend you buy more RAM if you plan on keeping the PC for a while for gaming.\n\n- Get what you need. Don't buy 64GB of RAM so you can do your homework. Similarly, don't buy 8GB of RAM and get upset when things won't render quickly. \n\n- Just don't even look at RAM coolers.

The amount of hz a monitor is, is basically how many frames per second are pushed out. More frames = smoother, but it also = more GPU hungry.
